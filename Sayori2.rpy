    mc "What's going on?"
    n "Okay so..."
    n "We may or not have come up with a plan to put you in last..."
    n "Because we really wanted to see what you looked like in one of Sayori's dresses."
    "... seriously?"
    "That's the game plan?"
    mc "Well, now I have to win."
    n "Not if I have anything to say about it!"
    "Natsuki doesn't know the mistake she's made putting my dignity on the line."
    mc "Alright, let's play that game."
    mc "Never have I ever..."
    mc "Read a hentai doujin!"
    "All 3 of us step forward."
    "..."
    mc "..."
    n "..."
    s "..."
    "A powerfully awkward silence fills the room."
    s "I was... curious one day, people talk about them in chat rooms all the time, so..."
    mc "I do it... rarely, but sometimes..."
    "Natsuki refuses to explain herself as I and Sayori do. She instead shoots me a look."
    mc "Desperate times, Desperate measures." 
    n "Yeah, yeah."
    n "Never have I ever slept in a doghouse!"
    "Natsuki alone steps forward, beginning to close the gap between her and Sayori."
    s "Never have I ever won a game of Never Have I Ever!"
    "Sayori takes a step forward and completes the game."
    "I don't have the heart to tell her that's probably against the rules."
    "At this point, I'm three steps away from the goal. Natsuki is two steps away."
    mc "Never have I ever taken items from the top shelf of a store!"
    "I step forward."
    n "Ah come on, that was low!"
    mc "You know a lot about low, don't you Natsuki?"
    n "Oh yeah? Never have I ever looked for coins under a vending machine!"
    "Damn, that one had exposition to it, too."
    "Natsuki takes her step forward." 
    "I've got to make sure this next one is perfect..."
    "Never have I ever slept next to Sayori!"
    "I made sure my wording was perfect as not to imply anything lewd."
    "Me and Natsuki are neck and neck..."
    "Until she takes a step forward."
    "I pause."
    n "Be careful with your wording."
    n "I've slept next to Sayori too. We've had sleepovers before."
    n "Not in the same bed, but it still counts!"
    "... my own wording trick got me."
    "I stand there, one step from the goal, Natsuki and Sayori having already crossed it."
    "Natsuki puts on a face so smug it's blinding."
    n "Well, Sayori, you know what that means!"
    n "Go pick out your favorite dress!"
    s "I'll be right back!"
    "Great..."
    "Sayori comes back, dress in hand, and I excuse myself to the restroom to put it on."
    "As soon as I come out, a camera flash blinds my vision."
    mc "Hey, no one said anything about pictures!"
    s "Come on, [player]! Can I just put some make up on you? You'd look so cute!"
    n "Stand still, you're making the photo blurry! Remember, you've gotta wear that the rest of the night!"
    "Good grief..."
